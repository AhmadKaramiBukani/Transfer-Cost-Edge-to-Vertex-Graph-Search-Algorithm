This graph search algorithm transfers the cost of edges to vertices, coded in Python by the algorithm's designer, Ahmad Karami Bukani from Rojhalat Kurdistan.

This algorithm calculates the shortest and longest path with a new method and although the edges are not omitted. Instead of costs on edges, costs are placed on vertices and help in routing in the graph.

At universities and schools around the world, they draw graphs by connecting headlines by lines, while graphs at the edges and the costs of the edges at the top can, part of the complexity of the calculations Remove the shortest and longest route. The edges comprise the movement from point to point in the algorithm, if the costs of the edges are at the top and the costs in the edges are eliminated, the complexity of the algorithm will be reduced.

I have used the Python 3.12 programming language to implement the graphic search algorithm Transfer Vertex Cost to Edge and this algorithm contains two parts: 
A. Based on parametric selection, random graff production or admission graph  
B- Solve the shortest and longest graphs of graph  
 
I use random libraries and mathematical jacks as well as a number of array variables that I have used the list data type, and I have elaborated on the duplicate lines, and I will explain the important parts of the codes.
